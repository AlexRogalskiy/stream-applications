= Counter Sink

Counter that compute multiple counters from the received messages. It leverages the Micrometer library and can use various popular TSDB to  persist the counter values.

By default the Counter Sink increments the `message`.`name` counter on every received message. The `message-counter-enabled` allows you to disable this counter when required.

If tag expressions are provided (via the `counter.tag.expression.<tagKey>=<tagValue SpEL expression> property) then the `name` counter is incremented. Note that each SpEL  expression can evaluate into multiple values resulting into multiple counter increments (one fore every value resolved).

If fixed tags are provided they are include in all message and expression counter increment measurements.

Counter's implementation is based on the https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer library] which is a Vendor-neutral application metrics facade that supports the most popular monitoring systems.
See the https://micrometer.io/docs[Micrometer documentation] for the list of supported monitoring systems. Starting with Spring Boot 2.0, Micrometer is the instrumentation library powering the delivery of application metrics from Spring Boot.

All Spring Cloud Stream App Starters are configured to support two of the most popular monitoring systems, Prometheus and InfluxDB. You can declaratively select which monitoring system to use.
If you are not using Prometheus or InfluxDB, you can customise the App starters to use a different monitoring system as well as include your preferred micrometer monitoring system library in your own custom applications.

https://grafana.com/[Grafana] is a popular platform for building visualization dashboards.

To enable Micrometer’s Prometheus meter registry for Spring Cloud Stream application starters, set the following properties.

```
management.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled=true
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=prometheus
```

and disable the application’s security which allows for a simple Prometheus configuration to scrape counter information by setting the following property.

```
spring.cloud.streamapp.security.enabled=false
```

To enable Micrometer’s Influx meter registry for Spring Cloud Stream application starters, set the following property.

```
management.metrics.export.influx.enabled=true
management.metrics.export.influx.uri={influxdb-server-url}
```

NOTE: if the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#streams-monitoring[Data Flow Server metrics] is enabled then the `Counter` will reuse the exiting configurations.

Following diagram illustrates Counter's information collection and processing flow.
